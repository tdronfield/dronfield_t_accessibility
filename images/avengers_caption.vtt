WEBVTT - Some title

00:07.480 --> 00:09.800
(Police Sirens)

00:09.785 --> 00:13.205
You were made to be ruled

00:14.143 --> 00:16.143
(cars exploding)

00:16.607 --> 00:18.607
(military men aiming their guns followed by a military jeep with rubble surrounding them)

00:17.992 --> 00:20.496
In the end,

00:22.013 --> 00:23.823
it'll be every man for himself

00:25.747 --> 00:27.747
(cars exploding)

00:30.632 --> 00:32.632
(helicopter whirring)

00:32.984 --> 00:34.505
What do we do?

00:35.276 --> 01:01.857
(Dramatic rock music playing in the background)

00:36.604 --> 00:38.024
We get ready.

00:43.018 --> 00:45.527
There was an idea

00:45.555 --> 00:47.027
to bring together

00:47.847 --> 00:49.945
a group of remarkable people.

00:51.497 --> 00:53.537
So when we needed them,

00:54.124 --> 00:56.344
they could fight the battles

00:57.344 --> 00:59.024
that we never could.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.194
Gentleman,

01:05.983 --> 01:08.444
What are you prepared to do?

01:11.063 --> 01:13.394
No offence but I don't play well with others

01:13.683 --> 01:16.653
Big man in a suit of armour. Take that away, what are you?

01:16.754 --> 01:19.033
A genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist

01:19.212 --> 01:19.882
(Laughing)

01:20.127 --> 01:35.688
(rock music playing)

01:32.579 --> 01:34.168
If we can't protect the earth,

01:36.009 --> 01:37.789
you can be damn sure we'll avenge it.

01:38.092 --> 01:42.092
(Ironman flies across the city)

01:49.524 --> 01:51.734
Doctor Banner, your work in unparralelled 

01:51.843 --> 01:55.894
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster

01:57.831 --> 01:59.002
Thanks.
