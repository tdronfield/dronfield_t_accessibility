1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,800
(Police Sirens)

2
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:13,205
You were made to be ruled

3
00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:16,143
(cars exploding)

4
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:18,607
(military men aiming their guns followed by a military jeep with rubble surrounding them)

5
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:20,496
In the end,

6
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:23,823
it'll be every man for himself

7
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,747
(cars exploding)

8
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:32,632
(helicopter whirring)

9
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:34,505
What do we do?

10
00:00:35,276 --> 00:01:01,857
(Dramatic rock music playing in the background)

11
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,024
We get ready.

12
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:45,527
There was an idea

13
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:47,027
to bring together

14
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,945
a group of remarkable people.

15
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:53,537
So when we needed them,

16
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:56,344
they could fight the battles

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,024
that we never could.

18
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,194
Gentleman,

19
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,444
What are you prepared to do?

20
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:13,394
No offence but I don't play well with others

21
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:16,653
Big man in a suit of armour. Take that away, what are you?

22
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:19,033
A genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist

23
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:19,882
(Laughing)

24
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:35,688
(rock music playing)

25
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,168
If we can't protect the earth,

26
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:37,789
you can be damn sure we'll avenge it.

27
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:42,092
(Ironman flies across the city)

28
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:51,734
Doctor Banner, your work in unparralelled 

29
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:55,894
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster

30
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,002
Thanks.
