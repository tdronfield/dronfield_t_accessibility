WEBVTT - Some title

00:07.890 --> 00:10.890
The fate of the universe lies on your shoulders

00:12.464 --> 00:14.464
Now whatever you do,

00:16.518 --> 00:18.518
Don't push this button.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.433
Because that will set off the bomb immediately and we'll all be dead.

00:23.282 --> 00:26.282
(gasps)

00:26.019 --> 00:28.019
Now repeat back what I just said

00:27.959 --> 00:29.959
I am groot

00:29.005 --> 00:32.005
No! No that's the button that will kill everyone! Try again.

00:34.163 --> 00:36.163
I am groot.

00:34.163 --> 00:36.163
Uh huh

00:35.489 --> 00:37.489
I am groot

00:36.457 --> 00:38.457
Uh huh

00:37.802 --> 00:39.802
I am groot! 

00:38.360 --> 00:40.360
NO!

00:43.431 --> 01:14.431
(rock music playing)

00:44.647 --> 00:46.647
Showtime a-holes!

00:46.625 --> 00:48.625
(screams)

00:49.823 --> 00:51.823
(explosion and people falling)


00:50.821 --> 00:53.821
(Peter flying a spaceship and shooting at other spaceships, exploding them)

01:01.783 --> 01:03.783
Screw you, spaceship!

01:10.532 --> 01:12.532
(groot screaming)

01:13.843 --> 01:15.843
Does anybody have some tape out there? I wanna put some tape over the death button.

01:18.688 --> 01:20.688
Nobody has any tape.

01:19.697 --> 01:21.697
Not a single person has tape?

01:20.620 --> 01:22.620
You have an atomic bomb in your bag if anybody's going to have tape it's you!

01:24.972 --> 01:26.972
I have to do everything!

01:24.972 --> 01:26.972
You're wasting a lot of time with groot!

01:26.595 --> 01:28.595
I am Groot!

01:30.797 --> 01:32.797
That's a really bad sign.

01:32.556 --> 01:42.556
(rock music playing)

01:33.870 --> 01:35.870
(explosions, gun shots)

01:42.356 --> 01:44.356
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings. You feel.. love.

01:47.985 --> 01:49.985
Yeah, I guess yeah, I feel a general, unselfish love for..

01:51.623 --> 01:53.623
No. Sexual love.

01:53.043 --> 01:55.043
No. No I don't.

01:53.724 --> 01:55.724
For her! (pointing at Gamora)

01:53.850 --> 01:56.850
No!

01:55.898 --> 01:57.898
(Drax laughing)

01:58.400 --> 02:00.400
She just told everyone your deepest darkest secret!

02:00.548 --> 02:02.648
Dude! Come on I think you are over reacting a little bit.

02:02.653 --> 02:04.653
(still laughing, now pointing) you must be so embarrassed!

02:06.865 --> 02:08.865
Do me, do me, do me!

02:08.559 --> 02:10.559
(music playing)
