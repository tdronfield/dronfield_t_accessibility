1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,890
The fate of the universe lies on your shoulders

2
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:14,464
Now whatever you do,

3
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,518
Don't push this button.

4
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,433
Because that will set off the bomb immediately and we'll all be dead.

5
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:26,282
(gasps)

6
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,019
Now repeat back what I just said

7
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,959
I am groot

8
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:32,005
No! No that's the button that will kill everyone! Try again.

9
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:36,163
I am groot.

10
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:36,163
Uh huh

11
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,489
I am groot

12
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:38,457
Uh huh

13
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,802
I am groot! 

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,360
NO!

15
00:00:43,431 --> 00:01:14,431
(rock music playing)

16
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,647
Showtime a-holes!

17
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,625
(screams)

18
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:51,823
(explosion and people falling)


19
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:53,821
(Peter flying a spaceship and shooting at other spaceships, exploding them)

20
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,783
Screw you, spaceship!

21
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,532
(groot screaming)

22
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:15,843
Does anybody have some tape out there? I wanna put some tape over the death button.

23
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,688
Nobody has any tape.

24
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,697
Not a single person has tape?

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,620
You have an atomic bomb in your bag if anybody's going to have tape it's you!

26
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,972
I have to do everything!

27
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,972
You're wasting a lot of time with groot!

28
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:28,595
I am Groot!

29
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,797
That's a really bad sign.

30
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:42,556
(rock music playing)

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,870
(explosions, gun shots)

32
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,356
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings. You feel.. love.

33
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:49,985
Yeah, I guess yeah, I feel a general, unselfish love for..

34
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:53,623
No. Sexual love.

35
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:55,043
No. No I don't.

36
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,724
For her! (pointing at Gamora)

37
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,850
No!

38
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,898
(Drax laughing)

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
She just told everyone your deepest darkest secret!

40
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:02,648
Dude! Come on I think you are over reacting a little bit.

41
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:04,653
(still laughing, now pointing) you must be so embarrassed!

42
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,865
Do me, do me, do me!

43
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,559
(music playing)
