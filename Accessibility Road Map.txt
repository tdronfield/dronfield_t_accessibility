Accessibility Road Map/Planning


Design:
* Maintain linear flow that will make sense when tabbed through
* Make sure labels and inputs are in correct order to ensure correct use
* Include controls - will be accessible via keyboard
* No autoplay - annoying/impeding for some people


Code:
* Using semantic tags for their intended use - like button tags for clickable buttons, a href tags for links, sections for content wrappers.
* Using semantic header tags everywhere to make sure visual information can be represented non-visually.
* Writing content in paired groups to ensure linear flow so when screen reader views them 
e.g. having divs contain img and paragraph assoc. with one another
Make sure controls are fully keyboard accessible
* Using transcripts to supply seeing impaired with extra details
* Using captions to supply hearing impaired with extra details
* Podcasts and other audio need transcripts to read so hearing impaired can read the transcript
